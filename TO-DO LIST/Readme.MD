To-Do List Web Application

Project Overview:

The To-Do List Web Application is a simple yet powerful task management tool designed to help users organize and track their daily activities. This project allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed, ensuring they can manage their goals and tasks efficiently. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



Key Features:

Add Tasks: Users can input tasks into a text box and add them to the to-do list.


Remove Tasks: Tasks can be deleted individually by clicking a remove button (e.g., a cross or trash icon).


Mark as Completed: A checkbox is available next to each task, allowing users to mark them as completed. Completed tasks will be visually distinct from ongoing ones.


Persistent Storage: The application utilizes localStorage to save tasks, ensuring that the list remains intact even after the browser is refreshed or closed.


Interactive Design: A clean, minimalistic user interface designed with CSS to offer a seamless and distraction-free user experience.




Technology Stack:


HTML: Defines the structure of the application, including the task input box and list display.
CSS: Provides styling for the layout, task items, buttons, and responsiveness, with attention to modern, clean design.
JavaScript: Handles the core functionality, such as adding/removing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and saving tasks using the browserâ€™s localStorage.
Features in Detail:
Task Input: Users can quickly enter tasks into a text field and submit them by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking a button. Empty input submissions are blocked with an alert.
Task Management: Each task is appended to the list dynamically with a remove button and a checkbox. Users can click the checkbox to visually indicate a task is completed.
Responsive Design: The application is styled to be responsive, ensuring functionality on both desktop and mobile devices.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in localStorage, allowing users to retain their to-do list between sessions. The application automatically loads stored tasks on page load.
Possible Future Enhancements:
Priority Levels: Add the ability for users to set task priorities (e.g., high, medium, low) and filter tasks based on priority.
Due Dates: Allow users to set deadlines for tasks and view them in a calendar format.
Categories or Tags: Enable task categorization (e.g., Work, Personal) to allow better organization of tasks.
